# PizzeriaFrontend

## Description

This was an end of semester project. Though I have made a lot of mistakes and did not complete it, I learnt a lot.
PizzeriaFrontend is a web application designed to showcase and manage a pizza restaurant's online presence.
It provides an interface for customers to browse the menu, place orders, and interact with the pizzeria's services.
